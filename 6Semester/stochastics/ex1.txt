We executed 1000  times the first 20 steps of the markov chain and we captured the running state in state '1'  45 times
So we estimate the Pr[X_(20) in 1|X_1 = 1] by 0.045
We executed 1000  times the first 20 steps of the markov chain and we captured the running state in state '1'  44 times
So we estimate the Pr[X_(20) in 1|X_1 = 1] by 0.044
We executed 1000  times the first 20 steps of the markov chain and we captured the running state in state '1'  43 times
So we estimate the Pr[X_(20) in 1|X_1 = 1] by 0.043
We executed 1000  times the first 20 steps of the markov chain and we captured the running state in state '1'  44 times
So we estimate the Pr[X_(20) in 1|X_1 = 1] by 0.044
We executed 1000  times the first 20 steps of the markov chain and we captured the running state in state '1'  39 times
So we estimate the Pr[X_(20) in 1|X_1 = 1] by 0.039
We executed 1000  times the first 20 steps of the markov chain and we captured the running state in state '1'  43 times
So we estimate the Pr[X_(20) in 1|X_1 = 1] by 0.043
We executed 1000  times the first 20 steps of the markov chain and we captured the running state in state '1'  36 times
So we estimate the Pr[X_(20) in 1|X_1 = 1] by 0.036
We executed 1000  times the first 20 steps of the markov chain and we captured the running state in state '1'  38 times
So we estimate the Pr[X_(20) in 1|X_1 = 1] by 0.038
We executed 1000  times the first 20 steps of the markov chain and we captured the running state in state '1'  48 times
So we estimate the Pr[X_(20) in 1|X_1 = 1] by 0.048
